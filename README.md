# Image-Generating-Autoencoder
An autoencoder with embedded probability distributions designed to generate handwritten numbers

This project was originally produced as a group in google's colaboratory by the following four people: Amaael Antonini, Krystian Galik, Salman Shah, Zixin Zhang.

The purpose of the project was to build a standard autoencoder with multiple hidden layers and train it to encode the MNIST dataset, allowing us to use probability distributions to generate new data from the encoded dataspace. For details about the design and/or results of the project, refer to the report named "image-generation-autoencoder.pdf".

Please be aware that the code available here has simply been copied and pasted from our .ipynb notebook files and has not been tested to work in any other environment. Anyone planning to use the provided code in their own project should modify it as necessary.

**I'm currently in the process of cleaning this up and reuploading a clean, usable version of the code.**
