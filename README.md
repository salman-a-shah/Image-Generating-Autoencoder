# Image-Generating-Autoencoder
An autoencoder with embedded probability distributions designed to generate handwritten numbers

This project was originally produced as a group in google's colaboratory by the following four people: Amaael Antonini, Krystian Galik, Salman Shah, Zixin Zhang.

The purpose of the project was to build a standard autoencoder with multiple hidden layers and train it to encode the MNIST dataset, allowing us to use probability distributions to generate new data from the encoded dataspace. For details about the design and/or results of the project, refer to the report named "image-generation-autoencoder.pdf".
